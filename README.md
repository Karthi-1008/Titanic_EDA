# Titanic_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning on the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. This project involves handling missing values, visualizing survival patterns, and creating new features for better insights.

🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis – EDA & Data Cleaning
This project performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Kaggle Titanic Dataset.

📊 Key Highlights:

Handled missing values in Age, Embarked, and Cabin

Visualized survival patterns by gender, class, age, and fare

Created new features like FamilySize, IsAlone, and AgeGroup

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations

Dataset fully cleaned and ready for Machine Learning
